# Data Science Roadmap ðŸ¤–

All in one place, the best resources to learn Data Science with comprehensive and detailed roadmaps. Data Science is a vast field and it is very difficult to find the best resources to learn it. This repository is an attempt to solve this problem. It contains the best resources to learn Data Science with comprehensive and detailed roadmaps.

It also contains the best resources to learn Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and much more. This repository is a one-stop solution for all your Data Science learning needs.

It is a continuously evolving repository and I will keep adding more resources to it. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute to this repository, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Table of Contents

I will divide the resources into different levels of learning and will also provide the best resources to learn each topic. The levels of learning are:

- **Fundamentals before Data Science Stage 1**
- **Core Data Science Fundamentals**
- **Intermediate Data Science**
- **Advanced Data Science**
- **Data Science Projects**
- **Guide to Data Science Interviews**
- **Recommended Timeline to follow this roadmap**
- **Tips/Tricks for following the roadmap**

## Let's get ready to learn data science ðŸš€
